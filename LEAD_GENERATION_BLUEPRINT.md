# AVOIDING OVERWHELM: THE 5-5-5 RULE

# IMPORTANT MINDSET NOTES:

1. **Consistency > Perfection**: Better to post an imperfect blog than wait for perfect
2. **Volume First**: In the beginning, focus on volume (content, outreach, connections)
3. **Test Everything**: What works for others may not work for you - test and measure
4. **Build Relationships**: Every contact is a potential referral source
5. **Play the Long Game**: SEO and content take 3-6 months to pay off

## 🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE:

**Most businesses fail at lead gen because they:**
- Try to do everything at once
- Give up too soon (results take 60-90 days)
- Focus on tactics instead of strategy
- Don't track and optimize

**You'll succeed because you're going to:**
- Follow this step-by-step plan
- Focus on one phase at a time
- Track everything
- Stay consistent for 90 days minimum

**Your competitive advantage:** Most of your competitors won't do this work. The businesses that commit to consistent, strategic execution will dominate.
